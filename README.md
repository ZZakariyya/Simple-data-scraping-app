# Simple-data-scraping-app
I have already quite a bit experience with data scraping because of my job (2022-). But till now I wasn't really interested in putting any of my work on github. Now that my friend asked me to make an scraping app for him, it was time for me to put some effort in


Added working application for this project. Only thing left is making this app portable

App is now portable! It is more than 100mb so I can't upload here, but you can download from this link:
